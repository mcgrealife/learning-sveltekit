- the next.js style routing based on file structure is convenient (the __layout is also useful)
- this app also shows writable data from a store, which is updated based on a select value binding
- along with some simple svelte transitions
- deployed at [https://learning-sveltekit.vercel.app](https://learning-sveltekit.vercel.app) (Run `vercel --prod` to overwrite later)
